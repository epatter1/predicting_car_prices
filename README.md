## Predicting Car Prices

**[View Here!](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/epatter1/predicting_car_prices/blob/master/Predicting%20Car%20Prices_KNN.ipynb)** :eyes:

Here I'm using the the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set I work with contains information on various cars. For each car I have info about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the `motor's displacement`, the `weight of the car`, the `miles per gallon`, `how fast the car accelerates`, and more.

> Goal: determine optimal k-value(s) to predict car prices
